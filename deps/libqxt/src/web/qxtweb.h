/**
\defgroup QxtWeb QxtWeb
\brief    The QxtWeb module provides tools for creating web services using Qt.

QxtWeb provides tools for creating event-driven web services using Qt.

The general usage pattern is as follows:

\li Create a QxtAbstractWebSessionManager object, such as QxtHttpSessionManager, for each protocol that can interface to the service.
\li If using QxtHttpSessionManager, select a connector plugin, such as QxtHttpServerConnector.
\li Register a QxtAbstractWebService factory. The factory is invoked each time a new session is created and returns a service object
    for that session. QxtWebServiceDirectory allows you to register multiple services and selects between them based on the path.
\li Invoke QxtAbstractWebSessionManager::start() to begin accepting connections.

When a new visitor connects who does not belong to a session, a new service instance is created. When a request is received, a
QxtAbstractWebService::pageRequestedEvent() is dispatched to the service. When the service is ready to respond to the request, it posts
a QxtWebPageEvent to the session manager. This is done asynchronously; there is no requirement that the pageRequestedEvent handler
must respond to the request before the function ends, but such a response must eventually be posted or the web browser will eventually
time out.
