/**
 * \class QxtFileLock QxtFileLock
 * \ingroup QxtCore
 * \brief The QxtFileLock class provides a crossplattform way to lock a QFile.
 *
 * It supports the range locking of a file. The File will take parentship of the lock.<br>
 * The lock gets cleaned up with the QFile, and it is released when the QFile is closed.<br>
 *
 * Example usage:
 * \code
 * off_t lockstart = 0x10;
 * off_t locklength = 30
 *
 * QFile file("test.lock");
 *
 * //the lock gets deleted when file is cleaned up
 * QxtFileLock * writeLock = new QxtFileLock(&file,lockstart,locklength,QxtFileLock::WriteLock);
 * if(file.open(QIODevice::ReadWrite))
 * {
 *     if(writeLock->lock())
 *     {
 *          // some write operations
 *         writeLock->unlock();
 *     }
 *      else
 *          //lock failed
 * }
 * \endcode
 * \note QxtFileLock behaves different than normal unix locks on *nix. A thread can writelock the region of a file only ONCE if it uses two  different handles.
 *           A different thread can not writelock a region that is owned by a other thread even if it is the SAME process.
 * \note On *nix this class uses fctnl to lock the file. This may not be compatible to other locking functions like flock and lockf
 * \note Please do not mix QxtFileLock and native file lock calls on the same QFile. The behaviour is undefined
 * \note QxtFileLock lives in the same thread as the passed QFile
 * \warning due to a refactoring issues of QFile this class will not work with Qt from 4.3 on. This will be fixed in 4.3.2
 * \warning not part of 0.2.4
