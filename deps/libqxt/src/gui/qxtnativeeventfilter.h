    \class QxtNativeEventFilter QxtNativeEventFilter
    \ingroup QxtGui
    \brief A native event filter to access platform specific events.

    QxtNativeEventFilter provides access to platform specific native events
    without the need of subclassing QApplication.

    \note QxtNativeEventFilter requires QxtApplication.

    Example usage:
    \code
    qxtApp->installNativeEventFilter(myObject);

    class MyObject : public QxtNativeEventFilter {
        public:
            ...

            bool x11EventFilter(XEvent* event) {
                if (event->type == ...) {
                    ...
                }
                return false;
            }

            bool winEventFilter(MSG* msg, long* result) {
                if (msg->message == ...) {
                    ...
                }
                return false;
            }

            bool macEventFilter(EventHandlerCallRef caller, EventRef event) {
                if (GetEventClass(event) == ...) {
                    ...
                }
                return false;
            }
    };
    \endcode

    \sa QxtApplication::installNativeEventFilter()
 */

/*!
    \fn QxtNativeEventFilter::x11EventFilter(XEvent* event)

    Filters X11 events if this object has been installed as a native event filter.
    In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to filter the event out,
    i.e. stop it being handled further, return \b true; otherwise return \b false.

    \sa QxtApplication::installNativeEventFilter()

/*!
    \fn QxtNativeEventFilter::winEventFilter(MSG* msg, long* result)

    Filters Windows events if this object has been installed as a native event filter.
    In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to filter the event out,
    i.e. stop it being handled further, return \b true; otherwise return \b false.

/*!
    \fn QxtNativeEventFilter::macEventFilter(EventHandlerCallRef caller, EventRef event)

    Filters Mac events if this object has been installed as a native event filter.
    In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to filter the event out,
    i.e. stop it being handled further, return \b true; otherwise return \b false.
